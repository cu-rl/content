### Assignment

[OpenAI Gym Env CartPole-v1](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/)

We want to use SARSA(Î») (*easier version would be SARSA(0)*), an on-policy RL method
and later Q-Learning, an off-policy RL method to find the optimal policy.

##### Note: If you have some other Gym Env that you think is better for practice and is practical to solve using tabular RL methods, let us know.
